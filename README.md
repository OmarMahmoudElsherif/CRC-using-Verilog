# CRC Description
CRC can stand for multiple things depending on the context, but one common meaning is "Cyclic Redundancy Check." It is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital communication and data storage to detect accidental changes to raw data. It involves calculating a short fixed-size checksum (a value derived from the data) that is appended to the data and then checked at the receiving end to ensure the data's integrity.
